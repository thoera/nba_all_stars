The 2016 NBA season is just over (with one of the greatest comeback in history from Cleveland) and I will use that as a pretext to conduct a little analysis of the NBA All-Stars, that is the players who have been selected for the NBA All-Star Game at least once in their career.

This analysis is mainly (if not entirely) a graphical analysis made in `R` with the help of the well known `ggplot2` package. And a hint of `Shiny` and `radarchart`.

Data come from a variety of web sites ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), [Basketball-Reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com/)) with a little bit of web scraping (`Beautiful Soup` is a `Python` library designed for that particular task and a tool of choice).

All data and code are available.
